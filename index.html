    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>I'am a 21-year-old web development enthusiast from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. Currently pursuing my graduation,
        I am fervently working towards a career in web development. I am actively expanding my knowledge through
        Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Udemy course, which is equipping me with essential skills for creating dynamic and engaging
        websites. Despite being at the beginning of my journey, I have already applied my learning by building two
        HTML projects: "My Top 3 Movies of All Time" and "Birthday Invitation." These projects reflect my growing
        proficiency and creativity in web design. I am passionate about further developing my skills and eager to
        contribute to exciting web development opportunities as I continue to advance in my career.</p>
